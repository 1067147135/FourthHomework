Implementation content: walking/running animation (blender1D), jumping animation (state machine), attacking animation (montage), running and leaning (transforming bones), turning head to look at an object (viewing) 

I followed a tutorial at Bilibili and wrote a DemoCharactorAnimeBP animation blueprint to familiarize myself with the operation and composition of the animation blueprint. 

Not all of the source code are successfully uploaded to GitHub. Some resources in Aurora's resource package cannot be uploaded on the web page because they exceed 25MB. Uploading through git's bash command line will also fail because the file is too large/connection fluctuates. I also tried to use lfs to upload. But  after it shows that the upload is successful, I can't find it on the GitHub page. I downloaded the Aurora resource pack from the Unreal Marketplace. The size is between 2 and 3G. I don't know if the missing files can be complemented by importing it from the Unreal Marketplace.
