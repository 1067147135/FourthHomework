Implementation content: walking/running animation (blender1D), jumping animation (state machine), attacking animation (montage), running and leaning (transforming bones), turning head to look at an object (viewing) 
It is not fully consistent with the homework requirements. 
I followed a tutorial at Bilibili and wrote a DemoCharactorAnimeBP animation blueprint to familiarize myself with the operation and composition of the animation blueprint. 
But then I found that the material package used for this tutorial does not have any animation material that can complete the pitch function. 
Then I found a beginner animation material package that can redirect the animation blueprint to call the little white man, but this method is only applicable when the project is just created, and it will become very troublesome to redirect after writing most of it. 
But I still tried a little bit and got stuck at the redirection step and couldn't find a usable bone. 
I speculated that the possible reason is that the poses of the two models are not similar enough and need to be adjusted, but this seems to be more troublesome. 
If I have enough time, I can continue to study without the hassle, after all, this is also part of learning and training. 
But this week is my midterm exam week, and many school courses are still assigned as usual, and I still need time to complete my homework and review to make sure my GPA isn't too poor. 
So in the limited time I can only hand in one assignment that is not in line with the assignment requirements, sorry.

Not all of the source code are successfully uploaded to GitHub. Some resources in Aurora's resource package cannot be uploaded on the web page because they exceed 25MB. Uploading through git's bash command line will also fail because the file is too large/connection fluctuates. I also tried to use lfs to upload. But  after it shows that the upload is successful, I can't find it on the GitHub page. I downloaded the Aurora resource pack from the Unreal Marketplace. The size is between 2 and 3G. I don't know if the missing files can be complemented by importing it from the Unreal Marketplace.

实现内容：行走/奔跑动画（blender1D），跳跃动画（状态机），攻击动画（蒙太奇），奔跑身体倾斜（变换骨骼），头部转向看某物体（查看）
我这次作业的实现内容并不与作业要求完全一致。
我跟着b站的一个教程写了个DemoCharactorAnimeBP动画蓝图熟悉了动画蓝图的操作构成。
但是之后我发现这个教程用的素材包里没有能完成俯仰功能的动画素材。
接着我查到可以重定向动画蓝图来调用小白人的初学者动画素材包，但是这个方法只适用于项目刚开始写的时候，写了大多数再重定向就会变得非常麻烦。
但我还是进行了一定的尝试，然后卡在了重定向那步找不到可用的骨骼。我推测可能的原因是两个模型的pose不够相似，需要做调整，不过这看起来更麻烦了。
如果我有足够的时间的话我可以不怕麻烦继续钻研，毕竟这也是学习锻练的一部分。
可是这周是我的期中考试周，许多学校课程的作业也在照常布置，我还需要时间来完成作业以及复习备考以保证我的GPA不要太难看。
所以在有限的时间内我只能交出一份和作业要求不太一致的作业了，很抱歉。

GitHub并不是全部的代码，Aurora的资源包里的一些资源因为超过25MB无法在网页上上传，通过git的bash命令行上传也会因为文件过大/连接波动失败，我也尝试了使用lfs来上传，但是它显示上传成功之后我找不到它给我上传到哪里去了。Aurora资源包我是在虚幻商城下载的，大小在2到3G之间，我不知道能不能通过再从虚幻商城导入来补全缺失的文件。
